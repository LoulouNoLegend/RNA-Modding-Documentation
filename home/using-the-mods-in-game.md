## Q: How to use clothing mods

As of now, All clothing mods are replacements of the in-game clothing. E.G. A shoes mod, will replace the default shoes. So you **cannot** have 2 shoe mods at once. Shoes mods should automatically apply (_as of 5th June 2024 there is only one pair of shoes_) Pants mods usually say in the mod download description, if not, try all lower-body clothing. T-Shirts, Hoodies, Jackets, Coats etc. - try all the upper-body clothing. Head, Glasses, Hats - try all head based clothing. Headphones, Hats - try all headphones based clothing. Full model swaps e.g. [CJ swap](https://www.nexusmods.com/rooftopsandalleystheparkourgame/mods/4), [Spiderman swap](https://www.nexusmods.com/rooftopsandalleystheparkourgame/mods/15) - These models both swap the T-Shirts.

It's usually starts with a `CM_` prefix, for example: `CM_TOKYO`. But this should be mentioned in map mod page, or where it was originally posted.
