# Setup the project

**1.** Download the template project by clicking [here](https://github.com/LoulouNoLegend/CustomMapLoader-RooftopsAndAlleys/releases/download/PB1/UE\_CML\_MapTemplate.zip)

**2.** Extract the "rooftopsandalleys" folder somewhere on your pc.

**3.** Open the folder and then the "rooftopsandalleys.uproject" file.

**4.** In your content folder, rename the file `Label_MapName` to your liking by keeping the `Label_` at the start of the name. _(Right click on the file to rename or press F2)_

**5.** Open the file you renamed. The only setting you need to change is the second one. It's extremely recommended to change the _Chunk ID_ to a number between 100 and 100 000, so there's low chances of having the same mod number as someone else's mod. To check the list of maps and their chunk number so you don't have the same one, check the [mods and custom maps spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KTI7YAHB9UPp0qBvWWQ2\_R7W2hjgPLCR53FnauvCJ0A/edit?usp=sharing). You can then save with the disk icon at the top left and close the file.

**6.** After that, just go inside the _CustomMaps_ folder. Rename the part after `CM_` to the name of your map.

**7.** Right click and create a folder for all of your assets you are gonna use that has the name of your map _(not an obligation, but the name need to be unique to not interfer if the user as multiple custom maps installed)_

**8.** Create your map! If you need help to understand how Unreal Engine works to create maps, there's good tutorials on YouTube.
