# Install your map

**1.** Go to where you decided to package your map.

**2.** Go into _Windows > rooftopsandalleys > Content > Paks_.

**3.** There should be some files. The important ones are the ones with the _chunk number_ you set earlier in the _Asset Data_ file.

**4.** Select all these files and rename them to the name of your level, adding `_P` at the end. It should look like this.

**5.** Don't close the file explorer, we will need to copy these 3 files somewhere. Find and go into the files of your _Rooftops & Alleys_ game. You can simply go in steam, right click on your game and go to _Manage > Browse local files_.

**6.** It should open a file explorer right into the files of the game. Go to _RooftopsandAlleys > Content > Paks_ and create a folder named _mods_.

**7.** Go into the _mods_ folder and paste the 3 files you renamed earlier in there.
