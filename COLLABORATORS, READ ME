You guys can add notes or messages for other collaborators here.

Everything works with Gitbook. We need to be carefull when adding pages, etc so it appears correctly and don't break.

Also, if you modify something, it will sync with the gitbook page.

Gitbook also reads the .md and README files, so just add a file with no extensions if you want to add a note somewhere

There's a page here for explanations on how Gitbook works with the pages and everyting:
https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/git-sync
There are explanations on how SUMMARY.md works, etc.

I recommended using a README / Markdown file editor to create the pages etc, since you can directly preview it whilee working on it.
